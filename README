A lot of sample application that using Flickr API and ExtJS ... I've read many ones, most of them are too simple,
or just obsolate implementing with previous ExtJS. I am using latest ExtJS 4.2, it was a big update and quite different.

The purpose of application to illustrate these feature:
1. Building application with MVC Pattern
2. Illustrating multple screens (I used to be familiar with Flex before and always looking for this)
3. Inovoking Flickr API and mapping to model / store. The sample from Sencha blog did not help me much so I was trying
implement from scratch
4. Xtemplate
5. How to get references of different views from controller
6. Could not remember all, but hope you can leave me some feedback

I also public my Flickr API key, feel free to use it but you should create and use your own. The application keeps
going on update ...
