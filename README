A lot of sample application that using Flickr API and ExtJS ... I've read many ones, most of them are too simple,
or just obsolete implementing with previous ExtJS. I am using latest ExtJS 4.2, it was a big update and quite different.

The purpose of application to illustrate these feature:
1. Building application with MVC Pattern
2. Illustrating multple screens (I used to be familiar with Flex before and always looking for this)
3. Invoking Flickr API and mapping to model / store. The sample from Sencha blog did not help me much so I was trying
implement from scratch
4. Xtemplate
5. How to get references of different views from controller
6. Unit testing (update by 08, April, 2013)
Jasmine is available for unit testing with Ext JS. Almost case study or example talks about testing with logic, store
or controller but not view. I am trying to integrate the UI unit testing but keep the opinion is unit testing not
suitable for UI.

I also public my Flickr API key, feel free to use it but you should create and use your own. The application keeps
going on update ...
